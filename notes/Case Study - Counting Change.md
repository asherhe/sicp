# Case Study - Counting Change

*(p. 51)*

> [!quote] Excerpt from the book
> It takes only a bit of cleverness to come up with the iterative Fibonacci algorithm. In contrast, consider the following problem: How many different ways can we make change of $1.00, given half-dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies? More generally, can we write a procedure to compute the number of ways to change any given amount of money?

*(just as a unrelated comment, the next sentence is a bit of an understatement:)*
